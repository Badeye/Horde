# Horde
### Overview
Horde is a plugin responsible for most of the logic behind the custom minecraft gamemode I am creating. You can find more info about it [here](http://mindhook.net/minecraft-horde/).
It is a fast-paced zombie survival mode, enforced through a carefully designed map, mods, texture packs and plugins.

### Features
* Player visibility bar, displayed through experience meter. Higher visibility values attract more zombies.
* Signs displaying player specific item information for buying upgrades.
* Zombies drop currency on death. When collected, a designated inventory item's lore will display the current balance.
* Bleeding on hit by chance and wound fixing.
* Timed combat logging protection with fee.
* Protected lobby by radius, in which a special lobby scoreboard gets displayed, items can be bought and players are invincible.
* Zombies can't break doors
* Dead players leave a tombstone (skull) on their position of death, containing all of their inventory items. Tombstones remember what block they replace and will thus not harm the landscape.
* Randomized spawns, each time a player spawns one of many different pre-set spawn points gets chosen.
